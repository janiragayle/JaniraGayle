## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
###  [Rate My Professor Chatbox](https://github.com/cindyweng18/rmp-ai-assistant)
- Implemented a web scraper that automatically extracts data from Rate my Professor and upsert to a Pinecone index, integrated with a RAG pipeline using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-4o to get up-to-date and relevant answers to user queries. *currently uses mock data
###  [Flashcard Generator](https://github.com/cindyweng18/flashcard-saas)
- Collaborated with 3 engineers to build and deploy a SaaS product that generates dynamic flashcards based on any topic using the Llama 3.1 LLM via the Groq API, integrated a paywall and custom pricing plans using the Stripe API

###  [South American Recipe Catalogue]()
- A Latin American recipe website that acts as a multi-generational database to preserve cultural dishes.
  
**Motivations:** Immigration and language barriers between generations often result in many unwritten recipes being lost. I want to create a digital database and community that allows Latin Americans and Carribbean families to perserve their family recipes while also being able to engage with recpies from other families. 

## 👩🏽‍💻 I just finished ...
###  [Visual Art Portfolio Template (A)](https://github.com/janiragayle/art-portfolio-a) (July-2024)
- This is template (A) for a minimalistic visual art portfolio website.
- Click [here](https://art-portfolio-a.netlify.app) to preview the template!
- Heres how I've used the template to display my own art: [Janira Gayle's Art Portfolio](https://janiragayle.com/Art/index.html)

**Motivations**: It is important for visual artist to have a portfolio website to show their work. However, it can be very difficult to find an affordable and efficent design. This template is simple and straight to the point, perfect for any visual artist who wants to quickly display their art work.
###  [Pantry Tracker]()

###  [Affirmations Digital Clock](https://github.com/janiragayle/Affirmations-Clock) (April-2024)
- A digital clock that provides a short definition of every angel number it hits!
