## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. A little bit about me :

My name is Janira Gayle. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but my family is from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. I am a junior at Columbia University studying computer science and visual arts. My career goals consist of becoming a full-stack software engineer. As for visual arts, I hope to have my artwork displayed in a gallery long term, as well as participate in as many exhibits as I can!
