## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. A little bit about me :

My name is Janira Gayle. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but my family is from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. I am a junior at Columbia University studying computer science and visual arts. My career goals consist of becoming a software engineer. As for visual arts, I hope to have my artwork displayed in a gallery long term, as well as participate in as many exhibits as I can!

Through the CS courses I have taken at Columbia, such as Data Structures and Advanced Programming, I have gained proficiency in the programming languages Java and Python, as well as exposure to C! Currently, I am taking CS50's Web Development course where I am learning HTML, CSS, Django, SQL, and JavaScript. Check out the "I'm currently working on ..." section to see my progress!
